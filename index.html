            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p>
              Hi! I'm Ronja Baldursdóttir, currently studying Multimediadesign at the Copenhagen
              School of Design and Technology.

            <h3>What can I offer?</h3>
            <p>
              With a background in front-end development and design, I bring both creativity and
              technical expertise to the table. I have worked with tools like Figma, Illustrator,
              and Photoshop to bring ideas to life, translating them into websites using HTML, CSS,
              and JavaScript. I enjoy collaborative environments, getting inspiration from teammates
              while continuously refining my work through feedback.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>What are my goals?</h3>
            <p>
              I’m eager to join a dynamic team where I can continue growing my skills and developing
              as a multimediadesigner. My goal is to further evolve both individually and in a group
              setting, while gaining real-world insight into the industry.

          The past year I have been a part of making 10 websites, using my knowledge within digital
          design to generate ideas, working mostly in Figma or Illustrator. Thereafter implementing
          these ideas using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Here are some of my projects!

            <p>
              As my exam project for my second semester, I got the honor to establish an online
              presence for ALPHA management & artist services in form of a website and SoMe
              material. The website was built on a database with info about their signed artists,
              events, news and recommendations.
            </p>
            <p>
              As their only form of existing visual identity at the time was their logo, which gave
              us quite free reins in terms of creating their online image. Of course we worked close
              with ALPHA during the entire process to iteratively change and better the end product.

            </p>
            <p>
              Soup Shenanigans is a creative and simple game that runs using JavaScript and
              CSS-animations. The goal of the game is to swat the incoming flies away from your
              soup, while collecting as much garnish as you can to make a delicious dinner. The game
              elements are designed in Illustrator taking inspiration from flat design.

              (understandable…) so there is no way to actually play the game, but i have attached
              pictures of the design below.

            <p>
              In 2022 i got the honor to create and design a gin menu for Bastard Café’s ginbar. I
              had great fun with it, but have found it to be hard to keep up to date as it is
              printed out. Therefore we are currently working on getting it up and running as an
              online dynamic gin menu, using a database to update it more frequently.

              The wine bar Veranda was in dire need of a redesign of their website, and me and my
              group arrived just in time! We worked alongside the owner and the company’s graphic
              designer to curate the perfect website that balances between conveying important
              information to customers while staying true to Verandas existing visual identity.
